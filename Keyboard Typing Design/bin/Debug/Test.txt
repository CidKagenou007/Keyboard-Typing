Fang Yuan is originally a 500-year-old demonic cultivator, who is reborn into his younger self after his death. Equipped with centuries of experience, knowledge, and a hardened heart, Fang Yuan is determined to transcend the limits of life, seeking immortality and ultimate freedom. Unlike many traditional protagonists who value relationships and morals, Fang Yuan is driven purely by self-interest. He doesn't shy away from making difficult choices or sacrificing others if it serves his goals.
